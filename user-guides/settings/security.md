# Security

This section includes relevant settings to make your wallet use more secure.

### Profile
If a third person gets access to your computer and they know your PIN, they can log in to your profile. 
**Important**: Even though they know the PIN, they are not able to interact with your balance and NFTs.

#### Automatic logout

If you suspect that a third person has received access to your PIN, change it ASAP to keep your profile private. 


### Stronghold
Stronghold is the technology Bloom uses to securely store your seed phrase. To use the seed phrase to e.g. sign transactions, the password is required.
**Important**: Keep your password safe so that only you can access your funds! If a third person gets access to it, your funds may be in danger.

#### Stronghold timeout
